        <p><a href="../images/rwo-celebration.jpg"><img class="left" src="../images/rwo-celebration-thumb.jpg" /></a> The rain continues to plummet down relentlessly as "summer" starts in OCaml Labs. The most exciting news has been the public release of the <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a>, which hit the front page of the usual news aggregators and generated huge interest! This (reminiscent of the Xen 1.0 release) promptly took down servers for a couple of hours, but we managed to minimise downtime in time for the Californians waking up.</p>
<p>O'Reilly has also started selling PDF copies of the book under their <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024743.do">Rough Cuts</a> program. This gives you a copy of the final book when it's released too. Commenting is still open on the <a href="http://realworldocaml.org">online version</a>, so please do feel free to participate there if you have time.</p>
<h3 id="systems-projects">Systems Projects</h3>
<p><b>Mirage</b>: Anil and Dave did the last of the sweeping build changes to make Mirage friendlier to use for beginners. Previously, we required a custom OPAM switch to build kernels, but now we use <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-06-11">virtual packages</a> to separate the choice of compiler and packages. This of course breaks all our documentation, but we're going to do a big sweep in July before <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/109140">OSCON</a> with the new scheme. Vincent has also been burning through the core platform libraries, cleaning them up and adding documentation strings. He is also building a shared memory <a href="http://github.com/vbmithr/ocaml-vchan">vchan</a> driver that will make parallel-Mirage unikernels very easy to coordinate on the same host.</p>
<p>The huge news from our friends at Citrix is the open-sourcing of <a href="http://www.xenserver.org">XenServer</a>, which is the popular Citrix product that embeds the <a href="https://github.com/xapi-project">OCaml XAPI</a> cloud management stack. There are almost 100 major components <a href="http://github.com/xenserver">released</a> as part of this, several of which can be directly reused with Mirage. Mirage was always an ambitious project, but it's all coming together now thanks to bold moves such as this from Citrix!</p>
<p><b>Signpost:</b> We woke up to the excellent but slightly scary news that our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci13">USENIX FOCI</a> paper was accepted. This now means that we get to present it in August at USENIX Security, but the team is now racing to pull together the prototypes into a complete system before the conference. Nothing like a deadline to focus the mind! We're also working on the camera-ready version of the paper, which we will share here when it's ready.</p>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform Projects</h3>
<p><b>OCamlot:</b> David Sheets did an astounding job at pulling together a working continuous build system in a very short amount of time, and promptly managed to melt some of the older <a href="../tasks/platform.html#Machine%20Pool">non-x86 machines</a> in Anil's office. Once Anil sadly replaced them, the builder churned through a matrix of different compiler versions (4.0,4.1dev,4.2dev), architectures (x86, x86_64, ARM, PowerPC), and operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OpenBSD to start with). There's a <a href="https://ocaml-www3.ocamllabs.cl.cam.ac.uk/github/OCamlPro/opam-repository">development URL</a>, but the next step is to retire this and move it to a proper home at <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a>.</p>
<p>Having continuous build for OPAM is really, really useful though, as it lets us vet pull requests on several architectures before merging them. It also let Anil repair OCaml on <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml/commit/c1da5f35cda0ee85e576197b88f503333ed9e9a1">OpenBSD/macppc</a> too, which is possibly the most obscure fix he's done in a while.</p>
<p>The next steps with OCamlot are to take a shot at porting the core to <a href="http://github.com/janestreet/jenga">Jenga</a>, which is Jane Street's next-generation distributed build system. This should let us improve the fault-tolerance and logging aspects of it before putting it properly into production later in the summer.</p>
<p><b>Ctypes:</b> The May <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes">release</a> brought with it a good chunk of feedback, so Jeremy spent time incorporating that and contributing to the Real World OCaml ctypes chapter. He also added support for garbage-collecting closures passed to C, and also very cool support for <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/27">printing C types and values</a>. Our friends at Citrix have started looking at ctypes, and Rob Hoes has already used it to write <a href="https://github.com/robhoes/ocaml-libnl">bindings</a> to the Netlink Protocol Library Suite.</p>
<p><a href="../images/daniel-presentation-vg.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/daniel-presentation-vg-thumb.jpg" /></a> <b>OPAM-doc</b>: Vincent Botbol got the documentation generator stable enough to pass the Core library through. This is particularly challenging since Core exercises pretty much every trick in the book when it comes to the use of the module system. However, Vincent successfully demonstrated the workflow of OPAM-doc at the end-of-month meeting, and is aiming to have a public release via OPAM in July (hopefully in time for the next beta release of Real World OCaml, which uses Core heavily).</p>
<p><b>Visualisation libraries:</b> <a href="http://erratique.ch/contact.en">Daniel B&#252;nzli</a> has been spending a few months based in Citrix, working on a foundational new declarative drawing library written in pure OCaml. The <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vg">Vg</a> is already quite functional despite still being in beta, and features a <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vg/demos/rhtmlc.html#arrowhead">Javascript backend</a> that renders to both SVG and Canvas in HTML5. That's not all though! He's also developing the <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vz">Vz</a> visualization library that uses Vg to assemble more complex scenes and graphs. Daniel's going to joining us in OCaml Labs for the remainder of the summer, so we're looking forward to developing this more and using it on our various Platform projects such as OCamlot.</p>
<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>
<p><b>Real World OCaml:</b> As mentioned earlier, the beta release of RWO went splendidly, with a pleasing vibe that the book is what people expected. There were some interesting criticisms of the choice of Github authentication, but we've had over 6000 registered commentators despite this (and of course, we have plans <a href="http://nymote.org">brewing</a> to tackle the identity problem).</p>
<p>No beta release is perfect, of course, and our now-public commenting system has resulted in <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments/issues">over 1500</a> issues being raised. Well, that's all of Yaron, Anil and Jason's free time gone for some time!</p>
<p><a href="../images/amir-shisha.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/amir-shisha-thumb.jpg" /></a> <b>OCaml.org</b>: We're in the process of looking at the site as a whole and designing the workflow we'd like to have for growing and maintaining it. Some discussions have taken place about using Markdown in place of the current HTML snippets, which would make it easier for external contributors to get involved. In the meantime, Amir has converted the current site to Markdown format to see how this process would work in practice. You can see his experimenting and scripts in the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml.org-temp">temporary repo</a> in the <code>markdown-site/</code> folder. Philippe also showed off <a href="https://github.com/pw374/MPP-language-blender">MPP</a> at the internal meetings, and is stabilising it for a public release this summer (once it has been integrated into the ocaml.org workflow).</p>
<p>This month also had a number of programming language gurus show up at the Lab for the <em>Algebraic Effects and Handlers</em> workshop organised by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ss368/">Sam Staton</a>. Most of the group attended this, as we're all interested in how to encode effects for several of our projects (most notably <a href="../tasks/t2.html#Irminsule">Irminsule</a>).</p>
<p>We also enjoyed a visit by <a href="https://github.com/bvaugon">Beno&#238;t Vaugon</a>, who gave a talk on his <a href="http://oud.ocaml.org/2012/slides/oud2012-paper10-slides.pdf">OCamlCC</a> OCaml-to-C compiler, and also participated in a talk on <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaml_for_pic/web/index.php?id=ocapic">OCAPIC</a>. He also chatted with us about his alternative <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6017">GADT-based implementation of Printf</a>, which promises to both speed up and simplify the printer support in OCaml (and also relieve Mirage of another dependency on <code>libc</code>).</p>

        <p><a href="../images/thomas-nycoug-2013.jpg"><img class="left" src="../images/thomas-nycoug-2013-thumb.jpg" /></a> May is exam time in Cambridge, and the corridors of the OCaml Labs resounded with the wailing of frantic students finishing their dissertations and preparing for exams. We welcomed <a href="https://github.com/vincent-botbol">Vincent Botbol</a> to join us for a summer internship, and he started hacking on the new <a href="../tasks/platform.html#OPAM%20Doc">opam-doc</a> right away.</p>
<p>Anil, Thomas, Leo and Amir also visited <a href="http://janestreet.com">Jane Street</a> HQ in New York City, where we had a productive couple of days reviewing our projects and getting feedback from them about approaches to multicore and type system enhancements. <a href="http://ashishagarwal.org">Ashish Agarwal</a> also organised a fun evening with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-OCaml/events/117222022/">New York OCaml Users Group</a>, where Anil and Thomas presented our plans for the nascent OCaml Platform.</p>
<h3 id="systems-projects">Systems Projects</h3>
<p><b>Mirage:</b> This was a month of consolidation and bugfixing in Mirage. We've been settling into weekly meetings to coordinate the hacking between us and Citrix, and the minutes (<a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-05-14">1</a> <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-05-21">2</a> <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-05-28">3</a>) may be useful if you want to catch up. The biggest bugbear is always the build system, and we've been exploring the use of <a href="http://github.com/janestreet/jenga">Jenga</a> as the eventual async-aware coordination and build system for running Mirage kernels. Dave made great progress with a <a href="http://github.com/djs55/message-switch">message-switch</a> that coordinates multiple kernels, and Balraj fixed several performance regressions in the TCP/IP stack by building unit tests that spawn millions of parallel TCP connections.</p>
<p><b>Signpost:</b> We took a break from building prototypes to submit a paper on the basic design to the USENIX Free and Open Communications (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci13">FOCI 2013</a>) workshop. Haris and Heidi blazed a path on writing this paper, and we've got even more ideas rolling around about how to use DNSSEC to break the cloud deadlock. The <a href="http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns">ocaml-dns</a> continues to grow features too.</p>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform Projects</h3>
<p><a href="../images/nycoug-drinkup-2013.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/nycoug-drinkup-2013-thumb.jpg" /></a> <b>Ctypes:</b> Jeremy <a href="https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-06/msg00046.html">announced</a> the first release of a new foreign-function mechanism for OCaml that doesn't require you to write any C stubs at all! You can browse the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes">source code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/wiki/ctypes-tutorial">tutorial</a>, and install it via OPAM. This is very much the first 0.1 release, and we have exciting future developments to turn this into a full-fledged replacement for the fast-but-rather-difficult-to-use-right OCaml FFI.</p>
<p><b>OPAM-doc:</b> Vincent Botbol started building on Leo's work on the new <a href="http://github.com/vincent-botbol/opam-doc">opam-doc</a> tool. This is intended to replace the venerable <code>ocamldoc</code> with one that uses all the latest features of the compiler. In particular, it can use the new typed AST <code>cmt</code> output to avoid duplicating the compiler functionality, and can also build up a global package table to generate complete cross-references across an entire OPAM collection.</p>
<p><b>OCamlot:</b> David has been building up the libraries and tools needed for the <a href="../tasks/platform.html#OCamlot%200.2.0">continuous build</a> infrastructure. This includes much-improved <a href="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github">ocaml-github</a>, bindings, which are now being used to power the <a href="https://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a> site as well as well as OCamlot. In addition, he's got an interesting collection of regular expressions to automatically triage common failures from OPAM (such as missing external dependencies), that should help reduce the manual burden of getting thousands of tests results dumped on the small OPAM team.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-projects">Compiler Projects</h3>
<p><a href="../images/janestreet-hq-2013.jpg"><img class="left" src="../images/janestreet-hq-2013-thumb.jpg" /></a> <b>OCaml-Java</b>: Xavier Clerc has been hacking away at his next-generation OCaml-Java backend (using many new features in JDK7). He's released a <a href="http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/concurrency.html">preview</a> of the bindings to Java concurrency, and is looking for feedback on it.</p>
<p><b>Performance profiling</b>: Mark Shinwell has been hacking on improving the integration of the runtime with <code>perf</code>. This should give us the hooks to reliably track where memory was allocated. His branch isn't going to land in OCaml 4.1, but should be available as an OPAM switch for people to easily try out when it's more stable.</p>
<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>
<p><b>OCaml.org:</b> Philippe and Amir have been putting their heads together with Christophe and Ashish to turn the <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> build pipeline into something a little more structured. Philippe is building a <a href="https://github.com/pw374/MPP-language-blender">template processor</a> for this purpose. The OCaml site is a more complicated than the average site due to our desire to embed <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml">js_of_ocaml</a> interactive toplevels throughout the tutorials, and also to have active OPAM integration throughout the site to make it easier for newcomers to sample the language.</p>
<p>The design of a handful of pages are also now available to preview, if you don't mind some manual git cloning. The best way to do this is to clone the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml.org-temp">temporary repo</a> onto your local machine and look in the <code>new-design/_site</code> directory. There are examples of the home page, 100 lines of OCaml page and several others. Since we're just getting started with applying these changes the site isn't clicky (yet). For some extra fun, try resizing your browser window and see how the pages reflow to suit smaller (mobile) screens!</p>
<p><a href="../images/nyc-trip-balcony-view-2013.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/nyc-trip-balcony-view-2013-thumb.jpg" /></a> <b>Real World OCaml:</b> Anil, Yaron and Jason continue to work hard on getting a release out of the door. We shipped a final alpha6 this month that is chapter-complete, and have been preparing for a big public June release of the book. Thousands of comments have been received and closed already, making this an unusually active (but incredibly useful) ongoing review process. Leo and Jeremy also contributed portions of text for the Objects and FFI chapters in alpha6, and join Stephen Weeks as external contributors to the book.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leo himself has recovered from the elation of being granted his PhD, to the harsh reality of having to finish corrections. He has been forced by his colleagues to stop hacking on OCaml and submit his final thesis. Rumours are that he will reemerge in June after delivering his <a href="http://staticanalysis.org/SAS13/papers.html">SAS 2013</a> talk on using an implication-algebra generalisation of logic programming to concisely analyse OpenMP programs for parallisation opportunities.</p>
<p>This month's talk was courtesy of <a href="http://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=D1161&amp;LANG=en">Mathias Bourgoin</a>, who visited from France and gave a talk on his PhD work on GPU processing. His tool, <a href="http://www.algo-prog.info/spoc/web/index.php?id=spoc">SPOC</a> has been released onto OPAM and is a set of easy-to-use tools for generating CUDA and OpenCL code, and also a camlp4 extension to write external kernels directly in OCaml. Thanks for visiting, Mathias!</p>

        <p><a href="../images/leo-oculus.jpg"><img class="left" src="../images/leo-oculus-thumb.jpg" thumb="" width="150px" /></a> It's been a heads-down month of hacking at the Labs for April, as the group have settled into their projects and are concentrating on getting code out. We did take the opportunity to redesign the <a href="../tasks/index.html">project pages</a> as the active projects grew.</p>
<p>We welcomed <a href="../people/euan.html">Euan Harris</a> as a new visitor, and he has begun work on a distributed actor library in the vein of Erlang's <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp">OTP</a>. The prolific <a href="http://erratique.ch">Daniel B&#252;nzli</a> also joined us for the summer to work on his <a href="http://erratique.ch/software/vg/">Vg</a> visualisation library. He's based out of the Citrix offices, and is also contributing to the Xen project.</p>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform projects</h3>
<p><b>OPAM: </b> The project has entered a bug fixing stage after its release, and the package set has steadily grown via external contributors. David Sheets has been hacking away on the automated <a href="../tasks/platform.html#OCamlot">OCamlot</a> bot, and we released improved <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github">Github</a> API bindings. We're aiming to get OCamlot live and running in May, so stay tuned! There is a <a href="../tasks/platform.html#Machine%20Pool">steadily growing collection</a> of odd ARM and PowerPC devices in Anil's desk that will generally make it easier to test your OCaml code in unusual environments.</p>
<p><b>OCaml.org redesign:</b> Progress on the website continues and we're now working on the actual HTML/CSS from the earlier <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign">mockups</a>. We'll be publishing these in a fork of the website <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml.org">repository</a>, so do feel free to create issues there with your comments. Philippe has begun the <a href="../tasks/outreach.html#Meta%20preprocessor">MPP</a> templating tool to glue together all the website scripts more coherently. Discussions about this take place on the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> mailing list, which is open to all.</p>
<p><a href="../images/makespace-apr-2013.jpg"><img class="left" src="../images/makespace-apr-2013-thumb.jpg" thumb="" width="150px" /></a> The monthly OCaml get togethers in the <a href="http://makespace.org">Cambridge Makespace</a> are also really fun. This month saw around 30 people wander through the doors, and work through the latest excerpts of <a href="http://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a>. And around midnight, Jeremy and Leo competed to find more and more obscure <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5992">bugs</a> in the corners of the OCaml type system... You can track the subsequent meetups via the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/events/114286762/">NonDysFunctional Meetup group</a>, which includes functional programmers from around the Cambridgeshire area. Jon and Anil also attended the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/events/hack_europe_london/">Yahoo Hackday</a> in London, where Jon met a giant robot and started <a href="https://github.com/jonludlam/mssl">SSL bindings</a>, and Anil experimented with <a href="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-js-localstorage">js_of_ocaml LocalStorage</a> for Irminsule.</p>

<p><b>Mirage</b>: We've finally got a release date for the first preview of Mirage, which will be at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28956">O'Reilly OSCON</a> this July! Pulling together the release is a big endeavour, and the <a href="../tasks/mirage.html">team</a> has started weekly calls to work through the project. The minutes for these are online, so you can <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/tag/overview/meetings">browse</a> them to catch up. There's also a slightly scary <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/dev-preview-checklist">checklist</a> of all the libraries that need to be released before July, so the team has its work cut out for it! The Xen group also announced that it is joining the Linux Foundation, and the <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2013/04/xen-become-linux-foundation-collaborative-project">press release</a> gave Mirage a prominent mention as one of the key recent developments in Xen.</p>
<p><a href="../images/jon-robot-yahoo.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/jon-robot-yahoo-thumb.jpg" thumb="" width="120px" /></a> <b>Irminsule</b>: Thomas now has a full implementation of the git file format in his <a href="http://github.com/samoht/cagit">cagit</a> repository, and the interfaces for Irminsule's branch-consistent model are coming together. He gave a demo to the Mirage team, with <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-04-23">discussion notes</a> available.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-projects">Compiler projects</h3>
<p><b>Multicore and Concurrency</b>: Stephen Dolan's made great progress on bringing up a multicore runtime using <a href="https://github.com/stedolan/ocaml">thread-local storage</a>, which results in a surprisingly compact diff to the OCaml runtime. We're now moving onto the higher-level bindings to use the parallel runtimes effectively from within OCaml. We also began a <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/wg-parallel">wg-parallel</a> working group in order to start figuring out the evolution of the <a href="http://ocsigen.org/lwt">Lwt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/async">Async</a> concurrency libraries.</p>
<p><b>libffi</b>: Jeremy got frustrated by the difficulty of writing safe C bindings, and started the <a href="http://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes">ctypes</a> library, which offers a pure OCaml solution. This even includes managing callbacks across the OCaml/C divide, and uses <a href="https://github.com/atgreen/libffi">libffi</a> under the hood to remain efficient and platform-independent. There is the exciting possibility about hooking this library with the <a href="../tasks/compiler.html#Compile-time%20meta%20programming">compile-time metaprogramming</a> to eliminate all performance cost, so we're going to spend some time on this project to make it a well-documented alternative to the existing C FFI.</p>
<p><a href="../images/mezzo-talk.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/mezzo-talk.jpg" thumb="" width="120px" /></a> The OCaml Labs talk series continued with a visit from <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/">Francois Pottier</a> ad <a href="http://www.xulforum.org">Jonathan Protzenko</a> from the INRIA <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr">Gallium</a> research team. Jonathan presented their <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~protzenk/mezzo-lang">Mezzo</a> language, which places emphasis on aliasing and controlled access to mutation. This is of particular interest to several of our systems projects that do not require the full power of OCaml to build low-level systems components, and Raphael, Alan, Leo and Anil had productive discussions about how we could try Mezzo out when it's released.</p>

        <p>The OCaml Labs hackers continue to arrive, with <a href="../people/sheets.html">David Sheets</a> arriving from sunny San Francisco, and <a href="../people/xclerc.html">Xavier Clerc</a> visiting from the less-sunny <a href="http://www.inria.fr">INRIA</a> in France. David's done great work on several OCaml libraries such as <a href="http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp">Cohttp</a> and on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll9z1ULtgqo&amp;feature=plcp">WebGL</a>, and he's diving straight into a first release of <a href="../tasks/platform.html">OCamlot</a> before starting his PhD later in the year. Xavier will work on releasing his <a href="http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/">OCaml Java 2.0</a> rewrite this summer, which takes advantage of all the latest JDK features for non-Java languages.</p>
<p>A new research grant has also been awarded to <a href="../people/crowcroft.html">Jon Crowcroft</a>. The <a href="http://hubofallthings.wordpress.com">Hub of All Things</a> is a &#163;1.2m multi-disciplinary project funded by the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/Digital/Pages/home.aspx">RCUK Digital Economy Programme</a> and led by <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/people/profile/?wmgid=849">Irene Ng</a> in Warwick. HAT aims to create a home platform, under the user's control, where a market to exchange their personal data for new products and personalised services could exist. The Cambridge piece of this work will use <a href="../tasks/mirage.html">Mirage</a> for embedded systems programming, and <a href="http://signpost.io">Signpost</a>, to enable devices to connect and communicate with each-other across the edge network.</p>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform projects</h3>
<p><b>OPAM: </b> <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a>, the popular OCaml Package Manager, recently had its <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/03/14/opam-1.0.0.html">1.0 release</a>! OPAM has been in development for just over a year, and this is a significant milestone for the project. The OPAM <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues">package repository</a> has had over 500 issues, closed over 400 pull requests and now contains over 450 packages (and more than twice that number if you consider that multiple versions are available). This kind of user adoption is a fantastic sign for the OCaml community. We're very happy to be using OPAM as a key piece of the upcoming OCaml Platform and the continuous integration and test system.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign"><img class="right" src="../images/ocaml_home_v2-2-thumb.jpg" width="220px" /></a> <b>OCaml.org redesign:</b> Amir extended the Balsamiq mockups into more realistic static site designs that can be <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign">found on the wiki</a>. We're building on the theme we began with the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos">OCaml Logo</a>, but also including the full functionality we want for the revamped site. The samples should give people an idea of the colour schemes and images we'll be using, and feedback is <em>very</em> welcome. Next, we're creating the HTML/CSS templates we need to make these mockups a reality.</p>
<p><b>OCamlot</b>: Within hours of getting off the plane, David was already getting well into the OCaml-based test tool and working on the pieces we need to get to a usable first version. The OCamlot workflow was last described in Amir's <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">Balsamiq mockups</a> in case you want to catch up. This work is made all the more important as Jane Street continues to demonstrate their strong commitment to open-source by sending in OPAM pull requests <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/644">every week</a> for new releases of their <a href="http://janestreet.github.io">libraries</a>. The testing for these releases is currently handled manually and we're really looking forward to having them dealt with automatically!</p>

<p><a href="../images/asplos-mort.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/asplos-mort-thumb.jpg" thumb="ASPLOS served green drinks. Hmm" width="120px" /></a> <b>Mirage</b>: There is much preparation ongoing for the big <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Mirage_Incubation_Project_Proposal">xen.org incubation</a>, which has now been approved by the Xen community board. Vincent's work on <a href="../tasks/mirage.html">Mirari</a> is going very well, and he's updated the <a href="http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/install">Mirage installation</a> instructions to use Mirari instead of the manual process required before. <a href="../people/avsm.html">Anil</a> and <a href="../people/mort.html">Mort</a> also attended and presented the <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">ASPLOS 2013</a> paper in Houston. For the curious, <a href="http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/bens-beans-houston">Ben's Beans</a> is the only good coffee we could find suitable for a European in Texas.</p>
<p><b>Irminsule</b>: Now that the core of Mirage is heading for release, the team is turning their attention to the storage and distributed programming challenge. <a href="../people/tg.html">Thomas</a> and Anil have been working on a new policy-free, branch-consistent storage layer that exposed a raw git-like universe to Mirage applications. We're working on as part of the <a href="../tasks/t2.html">Trilogy2</a> that's investigating how to improve the reliability of congested datacenters.</p>
<p><a href="../images/heidi-signposts.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/heidi-signposts-thumb.jpg" width="130px" /></a> <b>Signposts</b>: <a href="../people/heidi.html">Heidi</a> gave an <em>excellent</em> talk about Signpost and the benefits it can offer internet users today <i>(see right)</i>. This was one of a set of talks that took place in the Computer Lab, organised by <a href="../people/mycroft.html">Alan Mycroft</a>, on open software and open hardware with speakers such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer)">Jon 'maddog' Hall</a> of Linux International. There was fairly unanimous agreement that Heidi's slides were better than Anil's.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-projects">Compiler projects</h3>
<p><b>Multicore</b>: Once the dreaded ICFP deadline was out of the way, Stephen, Leo, Raphael and Anil put their heads together to start architecting the support for parallel multicore support in the OCaml runtime. A key part of the design space is to maintain the sequential performance and simplicity of the existing runtime, but still make it easy to extend shared memory onto different cores. We'll have more details on this shortly when early prototypes are done and some benchmarks run.</p>
<p><b>Namespaces:</b> Leo's also been extremely busy in the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform">platform mailing list</a>, which has been the location for the discussion of namespaces. A few hundred emails have been exchanged on this topic and Leo has summarised the discussion and made proposals in his blog post about <a href="http://www.lpw25.net/2013/03/10/ocaml-namespaces.html">OCaml namespaces</a>. Although this is a complex issue, aspects of namespaces will be important to the work on the OCaml Platform so we look forward to the outcome of these discussions.</p>

        <p>Two new people joined the core team at Cambridge: <a href="../people/yallop.html">Jeremy Yallop</a> and <a href="../people/pwang.html">Philippe Wang</a>! Jeremy has extensive expertise with meta-programming and generic programming, and is initially looking at the <a href="../tasks/compiler.html#Camlp4%20redesign">camlp4 redesign</a>. Philippe has been taking on the challenge of running OCaml well on restricted embedded systems, which will also have knock-on benefits to x86 compilation with the same optimisations. <a href="http://www.x9c.fr">Xavier Clerc</a> also joined us for a day in advance of his visit in April, with much interest in his <a href="http://argot.x9c.fr">Argot</a> project and the upcoming <a href="../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign">redesign of OCaml.org</a>.</p>
<p>Two new research grants have been awarded that are relevant to the OCaml Labs mission:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K032968/1">Network-as-a-Service</a> is a 3-year grant to solve pressing problems in "Big Data" processing, and will enable us to continue to develop <a href="http://openmirage.org">MirageOS</a> and the use of OCaml and functional programming in this space. We're going to be collaborating with Imperial and Nottingham on this, with the Cambridge efforts led by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~awm22/">Andrew Moore</a>, <a href="../people/crowcroft.html">Jon Crowcroft</a> and <a href="../people/avsm.html">Anil Madhavapeddy</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://rems.io">Rigorous Engineering of Mainstream Systems</a> asks how we can use rigorous maths to improve the quality of mainstream computer systems. It is led by <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20">Peter Sewell</a> at Cambridge, and most of the tools (including <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/">Ott</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sao/lem/">Lem</a>) are written in OCaml and will benefit from the ongoing work at OCaml Labs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform projects</h3>
<p><b>OPAM</b>: <a href="../images/rdc-talk.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/rdc-talk-thumb.jpg" width="130px" /></a> We've been working hard on an OPAM 1.0 release, and Thomas and Anil have been sweeping through the package tree to stabilise the repository via automated builds. We also had a brilliant visit from <a href="http://www.dicosmo.org/index.html.en">Roberto Di Cosmo</a> from <a href="http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr">PPS</a>, who has contributed extensively to the open-source community over the years. He gave a talk on the <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/research/publications/infsof2012-mpm.pdf">challenges of handling large-scale versioning</a> of packages from a mathematical perspective (particularly applied to Debian), which is very useful input for the ongoing OPAM work.</p>
<p><b>Mailing lists</b>: A new <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opengl">opengl@lists.ocaml.org</a> was set up for those interested in OpenGL and WebGL on OCaml, and discussion so far has covered LabGL on the Raspberry Pi. There are also still plans to begin working groups for build systems and parallelism but will be announced in due course once the preparatory work has been completed.</p>
<p><b>Real World OCaml</b>: The book is now on <a href="http://www.realworldocaml.org">alpha3</a>, where Part 1 is nearly complete. New sections on installation and a more expanded prologue have also been included in this version.</p>

<p><b>Redesign: </b> As part of the <a href="../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign">redesign work</a>, and to showcase the kind of additional functionality we'd like to create, Amir put together a set of screencasts that talk though a wireframe demo of the new site. These short videos covered elements of design, the new documentation system and an overview of how the continuous integration system would work. You can read more and experience the clickable demo via <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg">Amir's blog post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="systems-and-compiler-projects">Systems and compiler projects</h3>
<p><b>Mirage</b>: Anil gave two tech talks about <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> this month at Citrix and Microsoft Research, as practise talks for <a href="http://asplos13.rice.edu">ASPLOS 2013</a>. Mirage itself is nearing a release, and <a href="https://github.com/vbmithr">Vincent Bernardoff</a> has joined the Citrix engineering team to help drive it to release. He's been primarily focussed on the build frontend (dubbed <a href="../tasks/mirage.html#Mirari">Mirari</a>) to make Mirage applications easier to compile out-of-the-box.</p>
<p><b>camlp4 redesign:</b> There has been more discussion about the future of camlp4 and <a href="http://www.lpw25.net/2013/02/05/camlp4-alternative-part-2.html">Leo posted another summary</a> on his thoughts for an alternative apporach to quotations.</p>

        <p>There's a lot of interest in the work we're doing, and the number of collaborative <a href="../tasks/index.html">projects</a> is increasing fast. We held the first monthly meeting in the Computer Lab, where <a href="../people/avsm.html">Anil</a> provided an overview of the <a href="../tasks/index.html">research work</a> that OCaml Labs is starting. An interesting theme of the discussion that followed was related to undergraduate teaching and how things like the <a href="../tasks/platform.html">OCaml Platform</a> and infrastructure would make it easier for students to get to grips with programming.</p>
<p>For the evening after the meeting, <a href="../people/amirmc.html">Amir</a> set up an informal OCaml hacking/tutorial session in Cambridge. Around 15 eager people attended the event in <a href="http://makespace.org">Makespace</a> (a community workshop), with most of them being new to the language. Anil introduced <a href="../tasks/outreach.html#Book%20review%20site">Real World OCaml</a> and shared the introductory chapters while Thomas provided help with OPAM. This turned out to be a great test of the installation process for newcomers to OCaml, as well as the book's instructions. A number of issues came to light, partly related to a perfect storm of package issues, which everyone is keen to improve. Despite these problems, attendees were very positive and were keen to see more gatherings like this in future. When Amir asked for feedback, pretty much everyone commented on how great the pizza was.</p>
<h3 id="platform-projects">Platform projects</h3>
<p>OCaml Labs also hosted its first visitor this month as <a href="../people/tg.html">Thomas Gazagnaire</a>, the CTO of OCamlPro, spent three weeks in Cambridge. Much effort was put into preparing Mirage for release, discussions about parallelism and the OCaml Platform, and anything where OPAM is a crucial component. Worth noting is that (at time of writing) the <a href="https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository">opam-repository</a> has now become the <a href="https://github.com/languages/OCaml">overall most forked OCaml project on Github</a>.<br />The <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/platform/">Platform mailing list</a> has also been formed for discussion regarding the OCaml Platform. Anyone interested in the discussions about the platform, which will include development on OPAM, should join this list.</p>
<p>Part of the Platform work involves creating a new <a href="../tasks/platform.html">design for OCaml.org</a>, which also <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-February/000194.html">kicked-off this week</a>.<br />Amir will keep people updated about progress via updates to the <a href="../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign">OCL website</a>, <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/">Infrastructure mailing list</a> and also by posting things to the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki">OCaml.org Github wiki</a>. The current stage of work involves thinking of the types of pages OCaml.org requires, in order to refine the templates we need. As part of this, we also commissioned a new logo for OCaml and although it's still under development, you can see the latest draft on the <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos">OCaml.org wiki</a>. Please send any feedback directly to Amir.</p>
<p><a href="../images/t2-kickoff-2.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/t2-kickoff-2-thumb.jpg" width="130px" /></a> The Real World OCaml book website was released as a <a href="http://www.realworldocaml.org">limited alpha</a> earlier in the month, with the aim of getting early feedback and comments. Each paragraph of the online book has commenting functionality, using Github issues as a backend. This means that each comment made on the book website creates a new issue on Github, which authors/commenters can track and discuss before editing the content. So far there have been over 250 comments on the alpha, with half them being dealt with already.</p>
<p>A new EU project also kicked-off called <a href="../tasks/t2.html">Trilogy 2</a>, which builds on the award-winning work from the original <a href="http://www.trilogy-project.org">Trilogy</a> project. OnApp (a member of Trilogy 2), will be providing the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-February/000198.html">cloud Infrastructure for ocaml.org</a>, and Thomas and Anil will be expanding the Mirage project into distributed computing under this umbrella. As befits an EU project, it kicked off with an especially nice dinner at <a href="http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk">Christ's College</a>...</p>
<h3 id="systems-research">Systems research</h3>
<p><b>Mirage:</b> This was formally proposed as an <a href="../tasks/mirage.html">incubated Xen.org project</a> and the proposal was put forward for <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Mirage_Incubation_Project_Proposal">community review</a>. There were many positive comments on the Xen mailing lists (along the lines of <a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-01/msg01084.html">"Mirage is cool stuff"</a>) and voting is currently underway by eligible members of the Xen community. Assuming a positive outcome, incubation would give the Mirage project greater visibility and access to resources. This would accelerate progress towards an alpha release in Q1/Q2 this year. In addition to this, a proposal for an <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013">OSCON talk</a> was also submitted and the camera-ready version of the ASPLOS paper is <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">now available</a>.</p>
<p><b>Illuminate</b>: A related research topic where Mirage could be useful is in embedded systems and the Internet of Things. One specific use case is the <a href="../tasks/illuminate.html">Illuminate Project</a>, where Mirage can be used to create appliances running on the ARM microcontrollers alongside an LED lighting network. Such a lighting system is now deployed in large parts of the Computer Laboratory and will form an excellent test-bed to explore these ideas further.</p>
<p><b>Signpost:</b>: <a href="../images/t2-kickoff-1.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/t2-kickoff-1-thumb.jpg" width="130px" /></a> Signpost is also achieving greater outreach with <a href="../people/crowcroft.html">Jon Crowcroft</a> discussing such technologies at a meeting in Dagstul on <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13062">Decentralized Systems for Privacy Preservation</a>. Cambridge also hosted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> from Google, where he is the Humanitas Visiting Professor in Media for 2013. Eric delivered a <a href="http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/2332/">talk</a> on the future of conflict, combat and intervention. Anil and Jon got an opportunity to discuss Signposts with him for 20 minutes, which was an interesting clash of opinions (we want decentralised identity, Google want it all to go through them). Either way, we're even more motivated to get the Signpost tech out to the big bad world as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Haris found his identical twin brother in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge#The_Master.27s_Lodge_and_Garden">St Johns Masters Lodge</a>...</p>
<h3 id="compiler-projects">Compiler projects</h3>
<p>Several mailing lists are in progress for various community-driven projects. The first of these is a working group on the future of syntax extensions in OCaml (<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4">wg-camlp4</a>). This group is chaired by <a href="http://alain.frisch.fr">Alain Frisch</a> and Leo White and has generated a great deal of discussion in the last two weeks. Leo is summarising his thoughts in a series of <a href="http://www.lpw25.net">blog posts</a> as he goes. Further working groups on parallelism in OCaml and build systems are under discussion and will be announced in due course.</p>
<p>As well as all the research and development activity we've also been recruiting. We've had several rounds of interviews and made a number of offers so hopefully we'll be announcing new members of the OCaml Labs team in the coming months. In addition, we'd also like to mention that Leo successfully defended his PhD Thesis in January. Finally, we'd like to welcome a new honorary member of OCaml Labs, Nathan Scott, born on 30th January.

        <p><a href="../images/cam-snow.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/cam-snow-thumb.jpg" width="130px" /></a> OCaml Labs kicked-off with an internal meeting of the Cambridge-based members, who battled endless snow to make it to the meeting. There are over 20 people involved just within the building and over 30 including those outside the University. We welcomed a few new members, including Leo White (Postdoc), Raphael Proust (PhD student) and Stephen Dolan (PhD student). At this initial gathering Anil talked over some of the projects that were already taking place in the Lab, as well as the new work that would be supported by OCaml Labs.</p>
<p>Significant progress was made on the research side too. <a href="../tasks/mirage.html">Mirage</a> has had a flurry of new releases as we prepare for a first public release, and we're in the final stages of being officially incubated as a <a href="../tasks/mirage.html">xen.org project</a>. <a href="../tasks/illuminate.html#Signpost%20prototype">Signpost</a> is also taking shape, mainly due to the addition of DNSSEC to the <a href="../tasks/illuminate.html#Signpost%20prototypew">ocaml-dns</a> implementation. There's been industrial interest in the applications of Signpost and the team is pursuing these for more use cases.</p>
<p>We also began work on a new website for the <a href="http://realworldocaml.org">Real World OCaml</a>. We took inspiration from our friends who wrote Real World Haskell, and the site will have commenting functionality so that people can suggest improvements before the book is finalised. As part of this, we also worked with a design firm to begin creating a <a href="../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign">new logo for the OCaml language</a>.<br />The logo will be placed into the public domain for use by anyone.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, Ashish put the new <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> website live, to much electronic <a href="https://twitter.com/jakedonham/status/281170330700095488">applause</a>. A great way to end 2012!</p>

        <p>OCaml Labs finally opened its doors with announcements from <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/109">Yaron</a> and <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/2012/10/19/announcing-ocaml-labs.html">Anil</a>! Although much of the remainder of November was spent on administration and wiring up machines for the forthcoming <a href="../tasks/platform.html#Machine%20Pool">test cluster</a>, we also celebrated the acceptance of a paper on <a href="../tasks/mirage.html">Mirage</a> to <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf">ASPLOS 2013</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../images/caml-consortium-20121101.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/caml-consortium-20121101-thumb.jpg" width="130px" /></a> We also had a very productive visit from <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com">OCamlPro</a>. Fabrice, Thomas and Pierre came over to discuss the new <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">OPAM</a> package manager and the plans for building an OCaml Platform in 2013. This was in preparation for the subsequent Consortium meeting of the industrial board of OCaml, where Anil was able to present (and get approved) an overview of what <a href="http://ocaml.org">ocaml.org</a> would become. You can see the <a href="http://anil.recoil.org/slides/OCaml-Consortium-2012-OCamlLabs.pdf">slides of his talk online</a>. An interesting thing to note is just how broad the set of OCaml language users are: right the way from formal methods, to systems projects, and even web developers.</p>
<p>Since the Consortium meeting, the infrastructure behind ocaml.org is being built out and there's already been helpful input via the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure mailing list</a>. A continuous build system has been put together for internal testing, with support from Citrix, and <a href="#opam">OPAM</a> itself continues to mature and grow in popularity.</p>
