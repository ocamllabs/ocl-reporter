The mirage developer preview should be a stable release of the mirage tools
and libraries in opam and a simple (tested) "Getting started guide" on the
wiki.

It should be possible to easily:

  1. build a self-hosting website and DNS server (without SSL)
  2. build and run stub-domains for xenstore and xenconsoled,
     demonstrating how mirage can be used to build critical
     infrastructure
  3. build a simple distributed system using multiple communicating
     mirage instances
