The Mirage project is being incubated as an official
[xen.org](http://xen.org) project. This will give us a neutral
community ground to continue long-term development of the libraries
and tools required to turn it into a robust, production-grade
exokernel.

To date we have:

- Created a [proposal for the Xen community](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Mirage_Incubation_Project_Proposal)
- Gone through a [formal voting process](http://markmail.org/message/ikpv4djvamqpqaez)
- Been [accepted into the xen.org incubator](http://markmail.org/message/ax66a2orx4gh7ak2)

The next stage is to continue working with
[Lars](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/User:Lars.kurth) on the new xen.org
properties and public announcements. 

In addition, Xen.org has become a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project and
MirageOS was prominently mentioned in the
[press release](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2013/04/xen-become-linux-foundation-collaborative-project)!
