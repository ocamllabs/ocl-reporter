<a href="http://trilogy2.org"><img class="left" src="../images/t2.png" /></a>[Trilogy2](http://trilogy2.eu) aims to develop a new Internet architecture based on the concept of
the _liquid network_. A liquid system should ideally allow resources including
bandwidth, storage and processing to be used by any application, whether they
are contributed by network operators, data centre operators or end systems.
Resources form a shared pool and applications can scale up and down in multiple
dimensions (storage, processing, bandwidth and energy usage) as needed, in a
continuous effort to enhance the usersâ€™ experience as measured in terms of key
metrics such as delay and battery life.

The Cambridge participation is primarily centered around three efforts:

* The [Mirage](http://openmirage.org) library operating system that provides the policy-free mechanism to implement the liquid OS.
* A highly adaptive PVTCP transport protocol that takes advantage of heterogenous network connections.
* The Irminsule storage substrate that cleanly separates block storage form 

Trilogy 2 is a 3-year EU [STREP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development) project that 
addresses the "[Pervasive and Trusted Network and Service Infrastructures: Future Networks](http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/programme/challenge1_en.html)" challenge.
