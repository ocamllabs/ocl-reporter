MPP (Meta  PreProcessor) is  a preprocessor that  is *designed*  to be
very  customizable,  very simple  to  use and  to  be  used with  most
programming  languages (e.g.,  OCaml, C/Java,  Ada) and  most document
description languages (e.g., HTML, (La)TeX, MarkDown).

MPP's main particularity  is that it allows to  embed most programming
languages   into   your  project   and   use   them  as   preprocessor
languages. This means  that the expressiveness of MPP  is only limited
by its users' knowledge of other programming languages.

Without MPP, you'd either use  no preprocessor at all or build complex
scripts to parse and process your programmes or documents.
