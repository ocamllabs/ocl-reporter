MPP (Meta  PreProcessor) is  a preprocessor that  is *designed*  to be
very  customizable,  very simple  to  use and  to  be  used with  most
programming  languages (e.g.,  OCaml, C/Java,  Ada) and  most document
description languages  (e.g., HTML, (La)TeX, MarkDown).

Two fundamental particularities of MPP:

1. it allows to embed most programming languages into your project and
use them as preprocessor languages. This means that the expressiveness
of MPP is mainly limited  by its users' knowledge of other programming
languages.

2.  MPP  is *meta*  because you  can use it  to produce  a specialized
preprocessor, which is a feature that is particularly important if you
want to build and provide a simple preprocessor for non-programmers.

Without  MPP,   if  the  language  you're  using   doesn't  provide  a
specialized preprocessor,  you'd either use no preprocessor  at all or
build  complex  scripts  to  parse  and  process  your  programmes  or
documents.
