Coming soon in 2013 and published by
[O'Reilly Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024743.do),
is the definitive practical guide to programming in
[OCaml](http://ocaml.org/).

This hands-on book will show you how to take advantage of OCaml’s
functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming styles with
recipes for many real-world tasks. It covers a range of topics on
building and maintaining fast, reliable code, with a pragmatic
emphasis on getting stuff done with community libraries such as Core
and Async.

The book starts with OCaml basics, including how to set up a
development environment, and moves toward more advanced topics such as
the module system, foreign-function interface, macro language, and the
ocamlbuild system. By the end of the book, you'll have learned how to
solve day-to-day problems in data processing, numerical computation,
system scripting, and database-driven web applications with the OCaml
multi-paradigm programming language.
