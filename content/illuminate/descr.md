<a href="http://#"><img class="left" src="../images/illuminate.gif" width="70px" /></a>Embedded computer systems that are low-power, physically mobile, 
and which contain actuators and sensors to interface and influence the "real 
world" are becoming increasingly common.  
Many people are referring to this collectively as the "Internet of Things".
We're building the core technology to make these distributed devices fundamentally more secure, reliable and easier to program.
This consists of three main bits of technology:

* The Mirage OS (described separately) to build specialised, type-safe embedded images.
* The Signposts coordination system for embedded devices to find each other securely across a complex edge network.
* The Irminsule (described in T2) persistent storage system to provide a flexible coordination workflow across such sensors.

A key first use case for here is revolutionising lighting systems.  Over the
next decade or so, lighting systems in buildings all over the world will shift
to using more energy efficient LEDs in place of traditional tungsten bulbs or
fluorescent tubes. As well as the important reduction in energy usage, this
transition opens up unprecedented opportunities for both lighting circuit
design and embedded systems.

Due to the nature of LEDs, it's feasible to consider deploying ubiquitous
sensor networks alongside the LED lighting in a building. Since issues of power
and communication are straightforward to tackle, such a network would allow
completely new types of applications and services to be developed. In addition,
there would also be a dramatic impact on the relationship between people and
the building.

We're creating this platform to allow others to build technology and services
based on such distributed networks. Such a platform tackles the questions
surrounding security, reliability, and accountability while working with
industry to enable new services.
