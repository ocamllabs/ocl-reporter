`Vg` is a declarative 2D vector graphics library for OCaml. It's a
baseline library with multiple output backends like PDF, SVG or the
HTML5 Canvas element. This project aims to build a "Tufte principled"
2D visualization library with some simple graphing widgets for data
visualisation.  In the longer term, the intention is to build a
declarative UI framework also.
