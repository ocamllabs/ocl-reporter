Templates are very useful to factorize efforts. There are many ways to
design  and make  templates. A  *template engine*  combines  data with
templates to generate documents or programmes.

This project consists in designing and building a template engine upon
MPP such that it can be  used to ease the implementation of web sites,
documents or programmes.
For  the   Illuminate  project,  it  means  making   easier  both  the
implementation of  web pages to  monitor energy consumption  and other
data, and the implementation of the lights manager.
