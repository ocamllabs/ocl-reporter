The rain continues to plummet down relentlessly as "summer" starts in OCaml
Labs. The most exciting news has been the public release of the [Real World
OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org), which hit the front page of the usual news
aggregators and generated huge interest!  This (reminiscent of the Xen 1.0
release) promptly took down servers for a couple of hours, but we managed to
minimise downtime in time for the Californians waking up.

O'Reilly has also started selling PDF copies of the book under their [Rough
Cuts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024743.do) program.  This gives you
a copy of the final book when it's released too.  Commenting is still open
on the [online version](http://realworldocaml.org), so please do feel free to
participate there if you have time.

### Systems Projects

<b>Mirage</b>: Anil and Dave did the last of the sweeping build changes to make
Mirage friendlier to use for beginners.  Previously, we required a custom OPAM
switch to build kernels, but now we use [virtual
packages](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-06-11) to separate the
choice of compiler and packages.  This of course breaks all our documentation,
but we're going to do a big sweep in July before
[OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/109140) with the
new scheme.  Vincent has also been burning through the core platform libraries,
cleaning them up and adding documentation strings.  He is also building a
shared memory [vchan](http://github.com/vbmithr/ocaml-vchan) driver that will
make parallel-Mirage unikernels very easy to coordinate on the same host.

The huge news from our friends at Citrix is the open-sourcing of
[XenServer](http://www.xenserver.org), which is the popular Citrix product that
embeds the [OCaml XAPI](https://github.com/xapi-project) cloud management
stack.  There are almost 100 major components
[released](http://github.com/xenserver) as part of this, several of which can
be directly reused with Mirage.  Mirage was always an ambitious project, but
it's all coming together now thanks to bold moves such as this from Citrix!

<b>Signpost:</b> We woke up to the excellent but slightly scary news that
our [USENIX FOCI](https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci13) paper was accepted.
This now means that we get to present it in August at USENIX Security, but
the team is now racing to pull together the prototypes into a complete system
before the conference.  Nothing like a deadline to focus the mind!  We're
also working on the camera-ready version of the paper, which we will share
here when it's ready.

### Platform Projects

<b>OCamlot:</b> David Sheets did an astounding job at pulling together a
working continuous build system in a very short amount of time, and promptly
managed to melt some of the older [non-x86
machines](../tasks/platform.html#Machine%20Pool) in Anil's office.  Once Anil
sadly replaced them, the builder churned through a matrix of different compiler
versions (4.0,4.1dev,4.2dev), architectures (x86, x86_64, ARM, PowerPC), and
operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, OpenBSD to start with).  There's
a [development URL](https://ocaml-www3.ocamllabs.cl.cam.ac.uk/github/OCamlPro/opam-repository), but
the next step is to retire this and move it to a proper home at [ocaml.org](http://ocaml.org).

Having continuous build for OPAM is really, really useful though, as it lets us
vet pull requests on several architectures before merging them. It also let
Anil repair OCaml on [OpenBSD/macppc](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml/commit/c1da5f35cda0ee85e576197b88f503333ed9e9a1)
too, which is possibly the most obscure fix he's done in a while.

The next steps with OCamlot are to take a shot at porting the core to
[Jenga](http://github.com/janestreet/jenga), which is Jane Street's next-generation
distributed build system.  This should let us improve the fault-tolerance and
logging aspects of it before putting it properly into production later in the summer.

<b>Ctypes:</b> The May [release](http://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes)
brought with it a good chunk of feedback, so Jeremy spent time incorporating
that and contributing to the Real World OCaml ctypes chapter.  He also added
support for garbage-collecting closures passed to C, and also very cool support
for [printing C types and values](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/pull/27).
Our friends at Citrix have started looking at ctypes, and Rob Hoes has already
used it to write [bindings](https://github.com/robhoes/ocaml-libnl) to the
Netlink Protocol Library Suite.

<b>OPAM-doc</b>: Vincent Botbol got the documentation generator stable enough
to pass the Core library through.  This is particularly challenging since Core
exercises pretty much every trick in the book when it comes to the use of the
module system.  However, Vincent successfully demonstrated the workflow of
OPAM-doc at the end-of-month meeting, and is aiming to have a public release
via OPAM in July (hopefully in time for the next beta release of Real World OCaml,
which uses Core heavily).

<b>Visualisation libraries:</b> [Daniel Bünzli](http://erratique.ch/contact.en) has
been spending a few months based in Citrix, working on a foundational new
declarative drawing library written in pure OCaml.  The [Vg](http://erratique.ch/software/vg) is already quite functional despite
still being in beta, and features a [Javascript backend](http://erratique.ch/software/vg/demos/rhtmlc.html#arrowhead)
that renders to both SVG and Canvas in HTML5.  That's not all though!  He's
also developing the [Vz](http://erratique.ch/software/vz) visualization library
that uses Vg to assemble more complex scenes and graphs.  Daniel's going to
joining us in OCaml Labs for the remainder of the summer, so we're looking
forward to developing this more and using it on our various Platform projects
such as OCamlot.

### Outreach

<b>Real World OCaml:</b> As mentioned earlier, the beta release of RWO went
splendidly, with a pleasing vibe that the book is what people expected.  There
were some interesting criticisms of the choice of Github authentication, but
we've had over 6000 registered commentators despite this (and of course, we
have plans [brewing](http://nymote.org) to tackle the identity problem).

No beta release is perfect, of course, and our now-public commenting system has
resulted in [over 1500](https://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments/issues)
issues being raised.  Well, that's all of Yaron, Anil and Jason's free time
gone for some time!

<a href="../images/amir-shisha.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/amir-shisha-thumb.jpg"></img></a>
<b>OCaml.org</b>: We're in the process of looking at the site as a whole and
designing the workflow we'd like to have for growing and maintaining it.  Some
discussions have taken place about using Markdown in place of the current HTML
snippets, which would make it easier for external contributors to get involved.
In the meantime, Amir has converted the current site to Markdown format to see
how this process would work in practice.  You can see his experimenting and
scripts in the [temporary repo](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml.org-temp) in
the `markdown-site/` folder.
Philippe also showed off [MPP](https://github.com/pw374/MPP-language-blender)
at the internal meetings, and is stabilising it for a public release this
summer (once it has been integrated into the ocaml.org workflow).

This month also had a number of programming language gurus show up at the Lab
for the *Algebraic Effects and Handlers* workshop organised by [Sam
Staton](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ss368/).  Most of the group attended this, as
we're all interested in how to encode effects for several of our projects (most
notably [Irminsule](../tasks/t2.html#Irminsule)).

We also enjoyed a visit by [Benoît Vaugon](https://github.com/bvaugon), who gave a talk on his
[OCamlCC](http://oud.ocaml.org/2012/slides/oud2012-paper10-slides.pdf)
OCaml-to-C compiler, and also participated in a talk on
[OCAPIC](http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaml_for_pic/web/index.php?id=ocapic). He
also chatted with us about his alternative [GADT-based implementation of
Printf](http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6017), which promises to both
speed up and simplify the printer support in OCaml (and also relieve Mirage of
another dependency on `libc`).
