OCaml Labs finally opened its doors with announcements from
[Yaron](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/109) and
[Anil](http://anil.recoil.org/2012/10/19/announcing-ocaml-labs.html)!  Although
much of the remainder of November was spent on administration and wiring up
machines for the forthcoming [test cluster](../tasks/platform.html#Machine%20Pool), we
also celebrated the acceptance of a paper on [Mirage](../tasks/mirage.html)
to [ASPLOS 2013](http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf).

We also had a very productive visit from [OCamlPro](http://www.ocamlpro.com).
Fabrice, Thomas and Pierre came over to discuss the new
[OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com) package manager and the plans for building an
OCaml Platform in 2013. This was in preparation for the subsequent Consortium
meeting of the industrial board of OCaml, where Anil was able to present (and
get approved) an overview of what [ocaml.org](http://ocaml.org) would become.
You can see the [slides of his talk online](http://anil.recoil.org/slides/OCaml-Consortium-2012-OCamlLabs.pdf).  An
interesting thing to note is just how broad the set of OCaml language users
are: right the way from formal methods, to systems projects, and even web
developers.

Since the Consortium meeting, the infrastructure behind ocaml.org is being
built out and there's already been helpful input via the
[infrastructure mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure).  A continuous build system has been put together for internal testing, with
support from Citrix, and [OPAM](#opam) itself continues to mature and grow in
popularity.
