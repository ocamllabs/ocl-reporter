<a href="http://ocaml.org"><img class="left" src="../images/ocaml-grey.png" width="70px" /></a>We are working on maintaining and extending the core OCaml compiler toolchain
and runtime. This consists of a variety of day-to-day tasks such as submitting
bug fixes, and also longer-term improvements to the type system and runtime
libraries (see below).

We are actively engaging with the wider OCaml community to ensure that any 
improvements and modifications we propose are thoroughly discussed, 
well-formulated and maintainable.
