Namespaces provide a means for grouping the components of a library
together. 

Up to now this has been achieved using the OCaml module system. Since
the components of an OCaml library are modules, a module can be created that
contains all the components of the library as sub-modules. However, there are
some critical problems with creating a single module containing the whole
library:

- The module is a single unit that has to be linked or not as a whole. This
  means that any program using part of the library must include the entire
  library.

- The module is a choke-point in the dependency graph. If a file depends
  on one thing in the library then it needs to be recompiled if anything
  in the library changes.

- Opening a very large module is slow and can seriously affect build
  performance.

These problems are caused by the runtime semantics of modules. Namespaces have
no runtime sematics and could provide a solution to these problems.
