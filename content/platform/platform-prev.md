The OCaml Platform is intended to combine the core OCaml compiler with
a coherent set of libraries, tools, docs and other resources.  The
direction of the Platform will be guided by the major users of OCaml
(including consortium members).

The first stage of creating the platform is to begin building OCamlot.  This process will help us identify and and refine the initial libraries and tools that should form part of v0.1 of the platform proper.  When OCamlot is complete, we'll be in a much better position to discuss what components should form v0.2 of the Platform.
