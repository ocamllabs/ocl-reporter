The OCaml Platform is intended to combine the core OCaml compiler with a
coherent set of libraries, tools, docs and other resources.  The direction of
the Platform will be guided by the major users of OCaml (including consortium
members).

The first stage of creating the platform is to begin building OCamlot.  This
process will help us identify and and refine the initial libraries and tools
that should form part of v0.1 of the platform proper.  When OCamlot is
complete, we'll be in a much better position to discuss what components should
form v0.2 of the Platform.

The current state of the Platform components was also presented at
[OCaml 2013](http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/slides/madhavapeddy.pdf).
